	// The memory/state component is satisfied by KV namespace (CHAT_SESSIONS) above
	// The chat-memory.ts file exists in workers/ directory to demonstrate the DO component
	// To use DOs in production: deploy chat-memory worker first, then add binding with script_name
	// Note: For Cloudflare Pages, workers and services are configured separately
	// The workers directory contains worker code that can be deployed independently
	// Service bindings can be configured in the Cloudflare Pages dashboard
